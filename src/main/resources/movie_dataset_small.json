He is the son of Margaret \"Meg\" (n\u00e9e Miller), a school administrator and teacher, and Amram \"Ami\" Ducovny (1927\u20132003), a writer and publicist who worked for the American Jewish Committee. His father was Jewish, from a family that immigrated from the Russian Empire and Poland. His mother is a Lutheran emigrant from Aberdeen, Scotland. His father dropped the h in his last name to avoid the sort of mispronunciations he encountered while serving in the Army.\n\nDuchovny attended Grace Church School and The Collegiate School For Boys; both are in Manhattan. He graduated from Princeton University in 1982 with a B.A. in English Literature. He was a member of Charter Club, one of the university's eating clubs. In 1982, his poetry received an honorable mention for a college prize from the Academy of American Poets. The title of his senior thesis was The Schizophrenic Critique of Pure Reason in Beckett's Early Novels. Duchovny played a season of junior varsity basketball as a shooting guard and centerfield for the varsity baseball team.\n\nHe received a Master of Arts in English Literature from Yale University and subsequently began work on a Ph.D. that remains unfinished. The title of his uncompleted doctoral thesis was Magic and Technology in Contemporary Poetry and Prose. At Yale, he was a student of popular literary critic Harold Bloom.\n\nDuchovny married actress T\u00e9a Leoni on May 6, 1997. In April 1999, Leoni gave birth to a daughter, Madelaine West Duchovny. Their second child, a son, Kyd Miller Duchovny, was born in June 2002.

On October 15, 2008, Duchovny's and Leoni's representatives issued a statement revealing they had separated several months earlier.A week later, Duchovny's lawyer said that he planned to sue the Daily Mail over an article it ran that claimed he had an affair with Hungarian tennis instructor Edit Pakay while still married to Leoni, a claim that Duchovny has denied. On November 15, 2008, the Daily Mail retracted their claims. After getting back together, Duchovny and Leoni once again split on June 29, 2011.", "photoUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/rZ2pEvu9IYsnHx3ElWUy4KgK3ia.jpg"}, {"id": 11705, "name": "Michelle Monaghan", "gender": 1, "birthday": "1976-03-23", "deathday": null, "biography": "American actress Michelle Lynn Monaghan's first notable roles were in episodes of Young Americans, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, both in 2001.

Wes's parents divorced when he was two and he spent most of his childhood with his Mom, sister and brother. On a whim, Wes's mother took his sister to a audition for a Tide commercial in Savannah, Georgia and brought Wes along. While waiting for his sister in the lobby, the casting director discovered Wes and at the age of five, he was offered a national campaign for Tide.  At the age of thirteen, Wes moved in with his father and without a lot of supervision and as a restless and rebellious teen, he was kicked out of high school and sent to the Gift Center in Lawrencville, GA to finish school. The Gift Center was a second chance school for troubled youth, offering very small classes and a higher standard of education than public school. While attending classes, a professional theater company out of Atlanta started a mentoring program with the school and Wes was chosen to write a play that was later performed by his classmates. It was from this experience that Wes found his passion for the arts.  After graduating high school, Wes joined the military. He worked as an aviation firefighter on the flight deck of the USS Essex, working in crash and salvage for four years. Wes' break into acting came just three months before his tour was finished when Denzel Washington chose his ship to shoot the movie Antwone Fisher. While searching for some authentic military guys for the movie, Wes was discovered by casting director Robi Reed and given his first movie making experience. That's when he decided he wanted to pursue his life long dream of acting. Following Antwone Fisher, Robi convinced Wes to make the move to Hollywood and shortly thereafter cast him in his first series regular role on Showtime's Barbershop.  Wes really started to get attention when Paul Haggis cast him along side Tommy Lee Jones as Corporal Steve Penning in In the Valley of Elah. Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role.  In 2009, Wes would go on to work with Oliver Stone in W. as Frank Benedict, George W's Fraternity brother.

The name may not be as familiar but his adorable, jug-eared presence was a well-known commodity throughout the Hollywood community at the time, and he was considered a reliable and talented tyke who could easily turn on the waterworks on command.\u00a0He was French-Canadian, born in Montreal on January 15, 1948. His birth name was Bernard Girouard.\u00a0His family relocated to Los Angeles where the boy started dance classes at age 3. He made a reputable debut on TV playing Prince Edward of Wales, the son of Henry VIII, on a \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\" presentation starring\u00a0Sarah Churchill. As one who could easily tug at the heartstrings, he often played sympathetic young boys with afflictions, such as his crippled youngster on an episode of \"My Friend Flicka\" or his wealthy asthmatic on \"Medic\". Tommy hit his TV peak at age 10 after being cast as Jody in the gentle, non-violent TV western\u00a0\n\nBuckskin\u00a0(1958) opposite\u00a0Sally Brophy, who played his widowed mom. Set in the frontier town of Buckskin, Montana, the show was seen from his young perspective, narrating each episode sitting on his corral fence and playing his harmonica. Although it only played for one full season, Tommy had comic books out with his character and his autograph was well in demand at parades, conventions and other public outings.\u00a0\n\nAfter the series' demise, Tommy continued on other shows, many of them westerns such as \"Rawhide\", \"The Rifleman\", \"Gunsmoke\" and \"Wagon Train\", not to mention recurring roles on \"Lassie\". Unable to find another regular series that could maintain the momentum, he also was starting to move in his awkward teens stage and this pretty much signified that the end was not far away. After years of scattered parts here and there, including a role in the exploitation film\u00a0Maryjane\u00a0(1968), he ended his career with a small part in the movie\u00a0The Moonshine War\u00a0(1970). Later years were spent as a writer, penning articles for a number of publications including \"Playboy\", the \"Los Angeles Times\" and the \"Village Voice\". He returned to acting as a young adult (shortening his name to the grown-up-sounding Tom Nolan) with a small part in the\u00a0Richard Gere\n\n\u00a0film\u00a0Yanks\u00a0(1979) and has since given it the old college try, appearing as a minor player in such films as\u00a0Fast Times at Ridgemont High\u00a0(1982),Up the Creek\u00a0(1984),\u00a0School Spirit\u00a0(1985),\u00a0Pretty Woman\u00a0(1990),\u00a0The Thing Called Love(1993) and\u00a0White Man's Burden\u00a0(1995). His most recent credit was as a valet in\u00a0Batman Begins\u00a0(2005). On TV he has been glimpsed in everything from waiters to courtroom deputies. Now having entered his fifth decade of acting, Tom continues to live in the San Fernando Valley area. - IMDb Mini Biography By:\u00a0Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net", "photoUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/54j3SEN3lVUbEAk0BedWABq1Kxo.jpg"}, {"id": 1808343, "name": "Adam Cropper", "gender": 0, "birthday": null, "deathday": null, "biography": "", "photoUrl": "src/main/resources/static/imgs/default-person.png"}, {"id": 40039, "name": "Josh Stewart", "gender": 2, "birthday": "1977-02-06", "deathday": null, "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nJoshua Regnall Stewart (born February 6, 1977) is an American actor best known for his role as Holt McLaren in the FX TV series Dirt.

His first acting roles were as a child in television series, including a lead role in the Western series The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (1963\u20131964). In the 1970s, he signed a ten-year contract with the Walt Disney Company, where he became, according to Robert Osborne, the \"studio's top star of the '70s\". In 1979, Russell was nominated for an Emmy Award for the made-for-television film Elvis. In 1983, he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture for his performance opposite Meryl Streep in the 1984 film, Silkwood. During the 1980s, Russell was cast in several films by director John Carpenter, including anti-hero roles such as former air force hero-turned robber Snake Plissken in the futuristic action film Escape from New York, Antarctic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady in the horror film The Thing (1982), and truck driver Jack Burton in the dark kung-fu comedy/action film Big Trouble in Little China (1986). Both Escape from New York and Big Trouble in Little China have since become cult films. In 1994, he had a starring role in the military/science fiction film Stargate. In the mid-2000s, his portrayal of U.S. Olympic hockey coach Herb Brooks in Miracle (2004) won the praise of critics. In 2006, he appeared in the disaster-thriller Poseidon, and in 2007 Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof segment from the film Grindhouse.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kurt Russell, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "photoUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/6g1d98oH4miG4k0ZiZWmF3Dt0bO.jpg"}, {"id": 18892, "name": "Goldie Hawn", "gender": 1, "birthday": "1945-11-21", "deathday": null, "biography": "Goldie Jeanne Hawn (born November 21, 1945) is an American actress, film director, producer, and occasional singer.

On the cast of TV's Laugh-In, the mod comedy show of the late 1960s, she flubbed jokes in a bikini and became one of the show's most popular co-stars. Hawn then proved the ding-a-ling act was just an act -- she won an Oscar for a supporting role in Cactus Flower (1969, with Walter Matthau) and turned in a solid performance in Steven Spielberg's The Sugarland Express (1974). She had one blockbuster, Private Benjamin, and has since had a steady career as a leading lady in hits and misses, often acting as her own producer. Her movies include 'Shampoo' (1975, starring Warren Beatty), 'Death Becomes Her' (1992, with Bruce Willis), 'The First Wives Club' (1996, with Diane Keaton) and 'The Banger Sisters' (2002, with Susan Sarandon).

Copeland was trained by former professional wrestlers\u00a0Sweet Daddy Siki\u00a0and\u00a0Ron Hutchinson. Throughout the 1990s, he wrestled in North American\u00a0independent promotions\u00a0early in his career. During his time in these promotions, he competed in singles and tag team competition, the latter with\u00a0Christian, his\u00a0storyline\u00a0brother. In 1997, Copeland signed a developmental deal with the WWF and began competing for the company later that year; he made his televised debut the following June under the ring name Edge. In July 1999, he won the\u00a0WWF Intercontinental Championship\u00a0at a house show in\u00a0Toronto, making it his first title reign with the company.\u00a0He and Christian\u00a0went on to win the\u00a0WWF Tag Team Championship\u00a0on seven different occasions. During this time, they gained notoriety in the tag team division, partly due to their participation in\u00a0Tables, Ladders, and Chairs matches. Overall, Edge won 31 championships in WWE, including eleven\u00a0world championships\u00a0(the\u00a0WWE Championship\u00a0four times\u00a0and the\u00a0World Heavyweight Championship\u00a0a record seven times), five Intercontinental Championships, one\u00a0United States Championship, 14 world tag team championships (a record 12\u00a0World Tag Team Championships\u00a0and two\u00a0WWE Tag Team Championships), and is one of only three wrestlers (Kurt Angle\u00a0and\u00a0Big Show\u00a0being the others) who has held every currently active male Championship in WWE. In addition to his championship accolades, Copeland won the 2001\u00a0King of the Ring\u00a0tournament, the first\u00a0Mr. Money in the Bank\u00a0in 2005 and 2007 when he defeated\u00a0Mr. Kennedy, which he is also the winner of the match to reclaim and cash in the contract, becoming the first to cash in and win both world titles, and the\u00a0Royal Rumble match\u00a0in\u00a02010\u00a0making him the only wrestler in history to achieve all three of those accomplishments. Aside from professional wrestling, Copeland has appeared in the 2000 fantasy film\u00a0Highlander: Endgame\u00a0and made guest appearances on television shows, including\u00a0The Weakest Link,\u00a0Mind of Mencia,\u00a0Deal or No Deal,\u00a0Haven,\u00a0MADtv\u00a0and made his movie debut as a leading actor in\u00a0WWE Studios'\u00a0Bending the Rules. Edge was inducted into the\u00a0WWE Hall of Fame\u00a0by his long-time friend and tag team partner\u00a0Christian\u00a0on March 31, 2012.

Duhamel is an American actor and former fashion model. He first achieved acting success in 1999 as Leo du Pres on ABC's All My Children and later as the chief of security, Danny McCoy, on NBC's Las Vegas. He is also well known for his role as one of the protagonists, Captain/Major William Lennox, in the box office hit Transformers as well as its sequels, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Transformers: Dark of the Moon.  He is the son of Bonnie L. Kemper, a physical education teacher, and Larry David Duhamel, an advertising salesman. His parents divorced during his youth, and although he remains close to both, he grew up with his mother and his three younger sisters, Ashlee, Mckenzee and Kassidy. Duhamel attended Minot State University and played as the back-up quarterback for the university's football team. He planned to attend dental school but dropped out one-and-a-half credits shy of his undergraduate degree.  Duhamel has stated, \"After college, I followed an ex-girlfriend to northern California, did a bunch of odd jobs.\" Duhamel had won the title of Male Model of the Year in an International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) competition in 1997. Duhamel began his acting career as an extra in the music videos for Donna Summer's song, \"I Will Go With You (Con te partir\u00f2)\" in 1998 and Christina Aguilera's song, \"What a Girl Wants\" in 1999. Later that year, he won the role of Leo du Pres on the ABC soap opera All My Children. His work on the show, especially his character's pairing with Greenlee Smythe (portrayed by actor Rebecca Budig), garnered critical acclaim. In 2000, he posed fully nude for Greg Gorman's \"As I See It\" photography book. In 2003, he earned a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for the Special Fan Award for America's Favorite Couple in 2002, shared with Budig, and a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Leo du Pres. Duhamel opted to leave All My Children in 2002 to pursue other acting opportunities. In 2003, Duhamel landed a prime time role on the NBC show Las Vegas, playing the head of security as Danny McCoy for the Montecito Casino. He succeeded James Caan as president of the Montecito after Caan departed at the end of the fourth season. The series was cancelled in 2008. Duhamel made his big-screen acting debut in 2004's Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! and continued on to star in the thriller Turistas (2006). After watching an episode of Las Vegas in which Duhamel's character had just returned from the war in Iraq, Steven Spielberg handpicked him for the role of Captain William Lennox in 2007's summer blockbuster film Transformers (a film for which Spielberg was the executive producer). Duhamel reprised the role for the sequel, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, released in June 2009, and again in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, due for release in July 2011. Duhamel was the official pace car driver for the 2009 Indianapolis 500 driving the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro Pace Car. Duhamel will star alongside Samuel L.

She began her acting career in 2001, with several minor television and film roles, and played a regular role on the Hope &amp; Faith television show. In 2004, she made her film debut with a role in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. In 2007, she co-starred as Mikaela Banes, the love interest of Shia LaBeouf's character, in the blockbuster film, Transformers, which became her breakout role. Fox reprised her role in the 2009 sequel, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Later in 2009, she starred as the eponymous lead in the film Jennifer's Body. Fox is also considered one of the modern female sex symbols and has appeared in magazines such as Maxim, Rolling Stone and FHM.\n\nFox was born in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the daughter of Gloria Darlene (n\u00e9e Cisson) and Franklin Thomas Fox. She has English, and smaller amounts of Scottish, German, French, Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), and Powhatan Native American, ancestry.She was raised \"very strictly Pentecostal\", but later attended Catholic school for twelve years. Fox's parents divorced when she was young. Fox's mother later remarried, and she and her sister were raised by her mother and her stepfather, Tony Tonachio. She said that the two were \"very strict\" and that she was not allowed to have a boyfriend or invite friends to her house. She lived with her mother until she made enough money to support herself.\n\nFox began her training in drama and dance at age five, in Kingston, Tennessee. She attended a dance class at the community center there and was involved in Kingston Elementary School's chorus and the Kingston Clippers swim team. At 10 years of age, after moving to St. Petersburg, Florida, Fox continued her training. When she was 13 years old, Fox began modeling after winning several awards at the 1999 American Modeling and Talent Convention in Hilton Head, South Carolina. At age 17, she tested out of school via correspondence in order to move to Los Angeles, California.\n\nFox has spoken extensively of her time in education; that in middle school she was bullied and picked on and she ate lunch in the bathroom to avoid being \"pelted with ketchup packets\". She said that the problem was not her looks, but that she had \"always gotten along better with boys\" and that \"rubbed some people the wrong way\". Fox also said of high school that she was never popular and that \"everyone hated me, and I was a total outcast, my friends were always guys, I have a very aggressive personality, and girls didn\u2019t like me for that. I\u2019ve had only one great girlfriend my whole life\". In the same interview, she mentions that she hated school and has never been \"a big believer in formal education\" and that \"the education I was getting seemed irrelevant. So, I was sort of checked out on that part of it\".

Over the following few years she played in several of William Shakespeare's plays in such roles as Ophelia in Hamlet, Juliet in Romeo and Juliet and Lady Macbeth in Macbeth. She branched into film work, and won a BAFTA Award as Most Promising Newcomer; however, most of her work during this period was in theatre. Not generally known as a singer, she drew strong reviews for her leading role in the musical Cabaret in 1968.\n\nDuring the next two decades, she established herself as one of the most significant British theatre performers, working for the National Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company. In television, she achieved success during this period, in the series A Fine Romance from 1981 until 1984 and in 1992 began a continuing role in the television romantic comedy series As Time Goes By.\n\nHer film appearances were infrequent until she was cast as M in GoldenEye (1995), a role she has played in each James Bond film since. She received several notable film awards for her role as Queen Victoria in Mrs. Brown (1997), and has since been acclaimed for her work in such films as Shakespeare in Love (1998), Chocolat (2000), Iris (2001), Mrs Henderson Presents (2005) and Notes on a Scandal (2006), and the television production The Last of the Blonde Bombshells (2001).\n\nRegarded by critics as one of the greatest actresses of the post-war period, and frequently named as the leading British actress in polls, Dench has received many award nominations for her acting in theatre, film and television; her awards include ten BAFTAs, seven Laurence Olivier Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Tony Award.\n\nShe was married to actor Michael Williams from 1971 until his death in 2001.

Yankovic's first top ten Billboard album (Straight Outta Lynwood) and single (\"White & Nerdy\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career.\n\nYankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases.

From there, David moved to Los Angeles, embarking on the path to a professional career. He was accepted to the University of Southern California, where he lived off-campus in the Delta Chi fraternity house.

His first major network production was an episode of House Of Cards, playing Buha - press secretary to Joel Kinnaman - in an episode directed by Robin Wright. This led to more television gigs, such as The Gifted, Lodge 49, The Originals, and many others. From there, David began entering the world of feature films, with a supporting role in Gemini Man, directed by the Oscar-winning director Ang Lee. Currently, he continues to act in both mediums.

As an actor, his work in the film Ray earned him the Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Actor as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a musical/comedy. He is also a Grammy Award winning musician, producing two albums which have charted highly on the Billboard 200: Unpredictable, which topped the chart, and Intuition.\n\nFoxx was abandoned seven months after birth, and was subsequently adopted and raised in Terrell by his mother's adoptive parents, Estelle and Mark Talley. Foxx had a strict Baptist upbringing and began piano lessons at the age of five by his grandmother's orders. He has often acknowledged his grandmother's influence in his life as one of the greatest reasons for his success. When he found that female comedians were often called first to perform, he changed his name to Jamie Foxx, feeling that it was an ambiguous enough name to disallow any biases. He chose his surname as a tribute to comedian Redd Foxx.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2001, Foxx starred in his own sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show, and in 1992 he made his film debut in Toys a comedy directed by Barry Levinson. Following Toys, his first dramatic role came in Oliver Stone's 1999 film Any Given Sunday, where he portrayed a hard-partying American football player. Foxx has since evolved into a respected dramatic actor. Foxx was featured as taxi driver Max Durocher in the film Collateral alongside Tom Cruise, for which he received outstanding reviews and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His standout performance, however, was his portrayal of Ray Charles in the biopic Ray (2004), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Foxx is the second male in history to receive two acting Oscar nominations in the same year for two different movies, Collateral and Ray.\n\nIn September 2007, Foxx was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.", "photoUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/hPwCMEq6jLAidsXAX5BfoYgIfg2.jpg"}, {"id": 24045, "name": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt", "gender": 2, "birthday": "1981-02-17", "deathday": null, "biography": "Joseph Leonard Gordon-Levitt (born February 17, 1981) is an American actor whose career as both a child and adult has included television series and theatrical films.

As a child Allen started to entertain at the early age of 5. \"He would hit the floor and break dance at the slightest sound of music\" Says his mother. At the age of seven things started to change for Allen due to a dangerous environment and some of his neighbors in Compton. He, his mother and two older sisters moved into a home in Rialto, California. His first foray into the entertainment business was dancing on Soul Train. This first love would lead him to his true love... Acting! Allen's senior year in high school is when the acting bug bit him. He performed in numerous comedy shows and pep rallies. After graduating he took some acting classes in the Inland Empire which put him in front of a manager by the name of Vance from Advance LA. This would help him make the transition to Los Angeles. His first appearance as a working actor would come soon afterwards. Starring in a PBS educational program called \"Madison Heights\" Allen portrayed the role of \"Tyrone\" a young street thug. Noticing the charisma and potential in Allen, Vance would later refer him to a woman that would change his life forever...Mrs. Bobbie Shaw Chance. Her alumni is some of the most wanted actors in the business such as Drew Barrymore, Giovanni Ribisi, Kiko Ellworth, and many other of Hollywood's elite. With Bobbie's help and that of an extraordinary fellow student by the name of Choice Skinner, Allen would grow from a young man with an extreme amount of raw energy and charisma to a bona fide \"A\" list actor. Allen quickly grew to love and understand the craft of acting. Shortly after joining Bobbie's acting studio, Allen booked his first big screen appearance in the hit film \"Friday After Next\" as a juvenile delinquent that would attack Ice Cube and Mike Epps with a pool stick. Currently Allen has a recurring role on the Emmy award winning soap opera \"The Young and The Restless\" as Jamal.

It was here, during his teenage years that he discovered music, acting and theatre. He received a bachelors degree in music education/trumpet from Clarion University and then spent the next three years as a high school band director in Northwestern Pa. From there, he moved to South Florida to work on a masters degree from the University of Miami in theatre/voice. After graduating, New York became his home as he pursued his love affair with story telling and performance.\n\nWithin three years, he was co-starring with Tammy Grimes, Off-Broadway in \"Mademoiselle Colombe\", when Harold Prince saw his work and invited him to join the Broadway company of \"Phantom Of The Opera\". Since then he has starred in Broadway productions working with Stephen Sondheim and John Doyle, regional theatre, opera, and an appearance at the White House for President George H. Bush. Symphonic concerts have taken him all over the world with Skitch Henderson and Peter Nero.\n\nEarly television appearances lead to more definitive work in film and episodic television, including \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\", \"Royal Pains\" and \"Sex&Drugs&Rock&Roll\". Recent film work includes \"Joker\", \"Red\", \"Diving Normal\", and \"Crime Partners\".\n\nAs a writer, his screen play \"Conduit\" finds the most cynical woman on earth traveling through time to alter the events of 33 AD. Outrageous exploits and shocking discoveries force her to confront personal demons or risk a cataclysmic change of history.\n\nKeith continues to make the New York area a home for his family, and when he's not busy on set or in the theatre, he spends much of his time pursing his love for flying. As a single engine pilot, his perfect weekend is a flight to some location where he can return to the outdoors, golfing, scuba diving, skiing, camping or fishing.\n\n(Biography by SYI.)", "photoUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/7n0VSMTeyTuvLfgv7x2TLG0YD9G.jpg"}, {"id": 1456745, "name": "James Ciccone", "gender": 2, "birthday": "1963-06-14", "deathday": null, "biography": "", "photoUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/2dkbTiC8rLovUIh5Vw3YSCsDuWH.jpg"}, {"id": 2428573, "name": "Rich Campbell", "gender": 2, "birthday": null, "deathday": null, "biography": "Rich Campbell is a New York City based composer, musician, teacher and actor.

Theron received critical acclaim for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster (2003), for which she won the Silver Bear, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Academy Award for Best Actress among several other accolades, becoming the first South African to win an Academy Award in a major acting category. In recent years, she has moved into the field of producing, both in television and film.\n\nShe received further Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for her performance in North Country in 2005, and a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance in Young Adult in 2011. In 2012, she appeared in Snow White & the Huntsman and Prometheus, both of which were box office successes. Theron became a U.S. citizen in 2007, while retaining her South African citizenship.\n\nTheron was born in Benoni, in the then-Transvaal Province of South Africa, the only child of Gerda (n\u00e9e Maritz) and Charles Theron (born 27 November 1947). Second Boer War figure Danie Theron was her great-great-uncle. Her ancestry includes French, German, and Dutch; her French forebears were early Huguenot settlers in South Africa. \"Theron\" is an Occitan surname (originally spelled Th\u00e9ron) pronounced in Afrikaans as [t\u025c\u02d0ron], although she has said that the way she pronounces it in South Africa is [\u03b8ron]. She changed the pronunciation when she moved to the U.S. to give it a more \"American\" sound.\n\nShe grew up on her parents' farm in Benoni, near Johannesburg. On 21 June 1991, Theron's father, an alcoholic, physically attacked her mother and threatened both her mother and her while drunk; Theron's mother then shot and killed him. The shooting was legally adjudged to have been self-defense and her mother faced no charges.\n\nTheron attended Putfontein Primary School (Laerskool Putfontein), a period she later characterised as not \"fitting in\". At 13, Theron was sent to boarding school and began her studies at the National School of the Arts in Johannesburg.

When Sam was five years old, his parents separated, at which point he and his father moved to San Francisco, where he subsequently grew up, while summers and other times were spent with his mother in New York.\n\nHe made his acting debut when he was ten years old, alongside his mother, and later attended J Eugene McAteer High School in a program called SOTA. While still in high school, he got his first big break when he appeared in the independent film Clownhouse (1989). The plot revolved around three escaped mental patients who dressed up as clowns and terrorized three brothers home alone--Sam played the eldest of the brothers. His next big break was supposed to have come when he was slated to star in a short-lived NBC TV-series called Dream Street (1989), but he was soon fired.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Sam returned to New York for good and for two years he had private training at the William Esper Acting Studio. During this period he appeared in a variety of roles, such as the ABC Afterschool Specials (1972): Over the Limit (1990) (TV) and HBO's Lifestories: Families in Crisis (1992): Dead Drunk: The Kevin Tunell Story (Season 1 Episode 7: 15 March 1993); the head thug in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990); and a guest-star turn in an Emmy Award-winning episode of Law & Order (1990), while working a string of regular day jobs and performing in plays.\n\nAfter a few smaller appearances in films such as Woody Allen's Celebrity (1998) and the modern version of A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999), in which he played Francis Flute, he had larger roles in two of the bigger hit movies to emerge: The Green Mile (1999) and Galaxy Quest (1999), wowing audiences and critics alike with his chameleon-like performances as a crazed killer in the former and a goofy actor in the latter.\n\nMore recently, he appeared in another string of mainstream films, most notably as Eric Knox in Charlie's Angels (2000) and as Zaphod Beeblebrox in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), while continuing to perform in smaller independent movies.

Creative writing served as Dean\u2019s self-therapy, helping her cope with a hard life of poverty and bullying (inside and outside her home). Dean took to writing and singing as an escape from her small Oklahoma town with no glimpses of a positive future.\n\nAt the age of 15, Dean and her sister Deandria moved to\u00a0Omaha, Nebraska; leaving her older siblings in Tulsa.\u00a0The separation made Dean dig deeper for a connection, finding solace in music and the local music scene. Singing in every studio, writing for local rappers and producers, Dean unknowingly grass-rooted herself.\u00a0Learning the ins and outs of her talent and creativity, at 20 years old Dean made a bold move and left Omaha with only $500 in her pocket. She drove 18 hours, alone, to\u00a0Atlanta, Georgia\u00a0with dreams of breaking into the music industry.\u00a0She sang for anyone who would listen. While at a\u00a0Gap Band\u00a0concert, music producer\u00a0Tricky Stewart\u00a0overheard Dean singing in the crowd along with the band.\u00a0He immediately asked her to set up a meeting. While going through her catalog of songs, Tricky was impressed by not only her voice but also her songwriting ability. He signed her to a small publishing deal that allowed Dean to grow and connect with other known writers and producers.\u00a0This opportunity provided Dean with the tools, tricks, and skills to writing potential Top 40 songs.\n\nAlthough her time with Tricky was a significant point in her career, Dean eventually parted ways and relocated to\u00a0Los Angeles, California.\n\nUpon relocating to Los Angeles, Dean began to build a name in the songwriting world. She was eventually introduced to\u00a0Polow da Don, and later signed to\u00a0Zone 4 Records/Interscope Records.\n\nIn 2009 Dean released her first single, \"Drop It Low\", which peaked at number 38 on the US\u00a0Billboard Hot 100, becoming her first US Top 40 single. Dean's big break came when she collaborated with super producers\u00a0Stargate, creating her first number one single, Rihanna\u2019s \"Rude Boy\". She went on to write \"What's My Name\", \"Where Have You Been\" and several other Rihanna hits, as well as Katy Perry's \"Firework\" and Nicki Minaj\u2019s \"Super Bass\".\n\nShe would go on to be named \u2018The Song Machine\u2019 in\u00a0John Seabrook's\u00a0The New Yorker\u00a0article.\n\nOutside of music, Dean has been able to establish herself as a voice-over talent. She landed roles in\u00a0Ice Age: Continental Drift\u00a0(2012) and\u00a0Rio\u00a0(2011).\n\nAfter making a great impression in the voice-over world, Dean was asked to audition for a small part in an upcoming movie about a girl A cappella group. She jumped at the chance to audition and landed the role of Cynthia Rose in the hit movie\u00a0Pitch Perfect\u00a0(2012), which also lead to her co-starring in\u00a0Pitch Perfect 2\u00a0(2015).", "photoUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/jJNJGxxofOwxGxfKLqGPNGXzBhd.jpg"}, {"id": 1254583, "name": "Jamie Dornan", "gender": 2, "birthday": "1982-05-01", "deathday": null, "biography": "James Dornan (born 1 May 1982) is an Irish actor, model, and musician.

She has performed in leading roles in a variety of films, ranging from romantic comedies and dramas to science fiction and action movies. Following early roles in films such as Dangerous Liaisons (1988), she rose to international prominence in 1994 following her role in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction for which she was nominated for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award. She starred in several more films throughout the 1990s such as The Truth About Cats & Dogs, Batman & Robin, Gattaca and Les Mis\u00e9rables.\n\nShe won a Golden Globe Award for the miniseries Hysterical Blindness (2002). Her career was revitalized when she reunited with director Quentin Tarantino to play the central role in two Kill Bill films (2003/2004), which brought her an additional two Golden Globe Award nominations and a BAFTA Award nomination.\n\nThurman was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Her father, Robert Alexander Farrar Thurman, a New York-born professor, is a Buddhist writer and academic. Her mother, Nena von Schlebr\u00fcgge, is a model who was born in Mexico City, Mexico, of German, Swedish and Danish descent. Thurman and her siblings spent time in the Himalayan town of Almora, Uttarakhand, India, during childhood, and the Dalai Lama, to whom Robert Thurman has long been close, once visited their home. She grew up mostly in Amherst, Massachusetts, where she went to Amherst Regional Middle School, then moved to Woodstock, New York. While her father gave his children a Buddhist upbringing, she has the same name as one of the Hindu goddess Parvati's alternate names, \"Uma\", which means \"light\" in Sanskrit. Regarding religion, she now calls herself agnostic.\n\nShe has three brothers, Ganden (b. 1968), Dechen (b. 1973), and Mipam (b. 1978), and a half-sister named Taya (b. 1960), from her father's previous marriage. She is described as having been an awkward and introverted girl who was teased for her tall frame, angular bone structure, enormous feet and unusual name (sometimes using the name \u201cUma Karen\u201d instead of her birth name). When Thurman was 10 years old, a friend's mother suggested a nose job. As a child, she suffered bouts of body dysmorphic disorder, which she discussed in an interview with Talk magazine in 2001.\n\nUma attended Amherst Public Schools. In the eighth grade, she discovered her love for acting. Talent scouts noticed her performance as Abigail in a production of The Crucible and offered her the chance to act professionally.

A first-dan black belt in Hapkido and TaeKwonDo with a specialty in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai and Mixed Martial Arts, Manel has been an aspiring martial artist since the age of 11.\n\nFor ten years of his life, Manel's training eventually led him in the company of some very important people, working various types of jobs protecting people, from bouncer to personal bodyguard, until one day he decided it was no longer for him. Eventually, he sold his car and flew to Thailand to pursue a career in competitive fighting, where his career would have remained lucrative until a near-deadly incident with a greedy, machete-wielding cab driver nearly took his life in 2009. And although Manel prevailed, his injuries cost him his fighting career.\n\nAs time passed with recovery, Manel had the good fortune of bumping into Jaika Stunts founder, veteran stunt performer and stunt coordinator Kaecha Kampakdee, whose most notable stunt and choreography credits include Daniel Bernhardt's acting debut - Bloodsport 2, Tony Jaa's sequelized epic thriller, Ong Bak 2 and Bollywood actor Allu Arjun's Iddaramayilatho. And upon his crossing of paths with Kampakdee, the rest would soon fall into place, with Manel working on a number of films doing stunt work and other small acting roles, including Iddaramayilatho and the comedic Hollywood hit, The Hangover 2 directed by Todd Philips, to name a few.\n\nAs of 2015, Manel is currently working on what he hopes to be his first-ever feature lead role based on the previously-shot shortfilm, Portrait Of An Angry Man, shot by cinematographer Kimbo Kim and Italian writer/director Joe Petrosino. Filmed about four years ago, Manel strongly considers Portrait Of An Angry Man, a \"lovely experience\" that fully embedded him as an actor. \"Without a doubt, I can say that this is the project that made me fall in love with acting and film making as I was involved all the way from the start to finish.\"he says. \"It is what made me realize how beautiful it really is to make a movie, or shortfilm in this case.\" Manel Soler will also be seen in the upcoming film, A Man Will Rise, which is still pending release. In addition, Manel Soler has worked with stunt coordinator Brett Chan on actor Nicholas Cage's 12th century romantic war epic, Outcast, with co-stars Hayden Christensen (Star Wars Episode 2 & 3, Jumper) and Crystial Liu (The Forbidden Kingdom, The Four) under veteran stunt coordinator Nick Powell (The Last Samurai, The Three Musketeers) making his directorial debut. Manel has also worked with Tony Jaa (Ong Bak Trilogy, Fast & Furious 7) and veteran actors and martial artist Dolph Lundgren (Expendables trilogy, Universal Soldier, Rocky IV), Michel Jai White (The Dark Knight, Spawn, Blood and Bone) and Golden Globe winer Ron Perlman (Hellboy 1,2, Drive) in the 2015 action thriller, Skin Trade.\n\nOn another, more personal note, Manel Soler has expressed his own fortitude, looking back on his life with resolve with the philosophy that everything that happened, from body-guarding and security, to an incident that nearly cost him his life, has happened for a reason.\u00a0  Written By:\u00a0Lee B Golden", "photoUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/rKB7De02MOZsx02Pmol4Xc0d4pl.jpg"}, {"id": 57130, "name": "Todd Phillips", "gender": 2, "birthday": "1970-12-20", "deathday": null, "biography": "American screenwriter and film director Todd Phillips made his first while a junior at NYU and it went on to become one of the biggest grossing student films at the time, even getting a limited theatrical release.; the feature-length documentary \u201cHated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies\u201d He is best known for directing the comedy films Road Trip, Old School, The Hangover, and Due Date.\n\nPhillips directed and produced the highest grossing R-Rated Comedy of all time \u201cThe Hangover\u201d (2009), Its worldwide gross currently stands at $480 million dollars.

Marisa also has a brother, actor Adam Tomei. As a child, Marisa's mother frequently corrected her speech as to eliminate her heavy Brooklyn accent. As a teen, Marisa attended Edward R. Murrow High School and graduated in the class of 1982. She was one year into her college education at Boston University when she dropped out for a co-starring role on the CBS daytime drama As the World Turns (1956). Her role on that show paved the way for her entrance into film: in 1984, she debuted with a bit part in The Flamingo Kid (1984). Three years later, Marisa became known for her role as Maggie Lawton, Lisa Bonet's college roommate, on the sitcom A Different World (1987).\n\nHer real breakthrough came in 1992, when she co-starred as Joe Pesci's hilariously foul-mouthed, scene-stealing girlfriend in My Cousin Vinny (1992), a performance that won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Later that year, she turned up briefly as a snippy Mabel Normand in director Richard Attenborough's biopic Chaplin (1992), and was soon given her first starring role in Untamed Heart (1993). A subsequent starring role -- and attempted makeover into Audrey Hepburn -- in the romantic comedy Only You (1994) proved only moderately successful.\n\nMarisa's other 1994 role as Michael Keaton's hugely pregnant wife in The Paper (1994) was well-received, although the film as a whole was not. Fortunately for Tomei, she was able to rebound the following year with a solid performance as a troubled single mother in Nick Cassavetes' Unhook the Stars (1996) which earned her a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She turned in a similarly strong work in Welcome to Sarajevo (1997), and in 1998 did some of her best work in years as the sexually liberated, unhinged cousin of Natasha Lyonne's Vivian Abramowitz in Tamara Jenkins' Slums of Beverly Hills (1998). Marisa co-starred with Mel Gibson in the hugely successful romantic comedy What Women Want (2000) and during the 2002 movie award season, she proved her first Best Supporting Actress Oscar win was no fluke when she received her second nomination in the same category for the critically acclaimed dark drama, In the Bedroom (2001). She also made a guest appearance on the animated TV phenomenon The Simpsons (1989) as Sara Sloane, a movie star who falls in love with Ned Flanders. In 2006, she went on to do 4 episodes for Rescue Me (2004). She played Angie, the ex-wife of Tommy Calvin (Denis Leary)'s brother Johnny (Dean Winters). At age 42, Marisa took a provocative role in legendary filmmaker Sidney Lumet's melodramatic picture Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007), in which she appeared nude in love scenes with co-stars Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Marisa then took on another provocative role as a stripper in the highly acclaimed film The Wrestler (2008), opposite Mickey Rourke.

As approachable as he is edgy, Jim is responsible for some of the funniest and most memorable moment in recent television (primetime, cable and late-night circuit and film. As a stand-up comedian, Gaffigan\u2019s clever, quiet style has earned him an unprecedented number of appearances on both CBS\u2019 LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN and NBC\u2019s LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN. \u00a0His recent one hour Comedy Central Special, CD and DVD, all entitled \u201cBeyond the Pale\u201d have catapulted Gaffigan to one of the most popular touring and recorded comedians in the country today. \u00a0The DVD for \u201cBeyond the Pale\u201d went Gold within the first six months. After Gaffigan\u2019s first appearance on DAVID LETTERMAN, the host personally chose him to develop a sitcom for World Wide Pants. \u00a0Eighteen months later, WELCOME TO NEW YORK debuted on CBS to critical acclaim. \u00a0He then co-starred with Ellen DeGeneres on her CBS sitcom THE ELLEN SHOW. \u00a0For two years he had recurring roles both on FOX\u2019s THAT 70'S SHOW and NBC\u2019s ED. \u00a0Jim has also had roles on SEX AND THE CITY, THIRD WATCH and each of the LAW & ORDER shows, among others. Jim can be seen this November in MY BOYS, TBS' first original scripted comedy series. On film, Jim has endeared himself to audiences by taking on vivid supporting characters in a number of genres. \u00a0In the cult hit SUPER TROOPERS, Gaffigan got huge laughs and famously helped add \"meow\" to the lexicon of Vermont state troopers. \u00a0Jim's quiet dramatic turn in THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL, a meditation on the aftermath of 9/11, took audiences and critics by surprise as he embodied an office worker broken by tragedy who ultimately explodes in rage. Gaffigan\u2019s other recent film credits include the forthcoming independent films THE LIVING WAKE and STEPHANIE DALEY. \u00a0He has also been featured in TRUST THE MAN, 13 GOING ON 30, THREE KINGS, FINAL, IGBY GOES DOWN, ENTROPY and THIRTY YEARS TO LIFE. \u00a0In 2004, he co-starred in TNT\u2019s BAD APPLE, with Chris Noth. Gaffigan recently signed on to co-write and lend his voice to 20 new episodes of PALE FORCE, a series of animated shorts that will air regularly on CONAN and on the internet via webisodes starting in October. \u00a0The series focuses on two pale crime-fighting superheroes that, like Gaffigan and O'Brien, are equipped with fair skin. Many recognize Gaffigan from his numerous award-winning commercial campaigns, which include Sierra Mist, ESPN, Saturn and Rolling Rock. \u00a0His commercial presence earned him Business Week\u2019s 1999 \"Salesman of the Year\" honour.

Johnson is half-Black and half-Samoan. His father, Rocky Johnson, is a Black Canadian, from Nova Scotia, and part of the first Black tag team champions in WWE history back when it was known as the WWF along with Tony Atlas. His mother is Samoan and the daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a pro wrestler. Maivia's wife, Lia Maivia, was one of wrestling's few female promoters, taking over Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982, until 1988. Through his mother, he is considered a non-blood relative of the Anoa'i wrestling family. On March 29, 2008, The Rock inducted his father and his grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nAs of 2014, Johnson has a home in Southwest Ranches, Florida as well as Los Angeles, California. He also owns a farm in Virginia. In 2009, Johnson gained citizenship in Canada in honor of his father's background. Though Johnson was previously registered as a Republican, he voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 United States presidential elections and is now an independent voter. He stated he did not vote in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nIn recognition of his service to the Samoan people, and because he is a descendant of Samoan chiefs, Johnson had the noble title of Seiuli bestowed upon him by Malietoa Tanumafili II during his visit there in July 2004. He received a partial Samoan pe'a tattoo on his left side in 2003,and, in 2017, had the small \"Brahma bull\" tattoo on his right arm covered with a larger half-sleeve tattoo of a bull's skull.\n\nJohnson married Dany Garcia on May 3, 1997. Their only child together, a daughter named Simone, was born in August 2001. On June 1, 2007, they announced they were splitting up amicably. Johnson then began dating Lauren Hashian, daughter of Boston drummer Sib Hashian. They first met in 2006 while Johnson was filming The Game Plan. Their first child together, a daughter, was born in December 2015. Their second child, another daughter, was born in April 2018.\n\nJohnson attended the 2000 Democratic National Convention as part of WWE's non-partisan \"Smackdown Your Vote\" campaign, which aimed to influence young people to vote. He also had a speaking role at the 2000 Republican National Convention that same year.\n\nIn 2006, Johnson founded the Dwayne Johnson Rock Foundation, a charity working with at-risk and terminally ill children. On October 2, 2007, he and his ex-wife donated $1 million to the University of Miami to support the renovation of its football facilities; it was noted as the largest donation ever given to the university's athletics department by former students.

He is known for providing the voice of Darth Vader in the Star Wars franchise and the tagline for CNN.  James Earl Jones was born in Arkabutla, Mississippi, the son of Ruth (n\u00e9e Connolly) and Robert Earl Jones. At the age of five, he moved to Jackson, Michigan, to be raised by his maternal grandparents, but the adoption was traumatic and he developed a stutter so severe he refused to speak aloud. When he moved to Brethren, Michigan in later years a teacher at the Brethren schools started to help him with his stutter. He remained functionally mute for eight years until he reached high school. He credits his high school teacher, Donald Crouch, who discovered he had a gift for writing poetry, with helping him out of his silence.  Jones attended the University of Michigan where he was a pre-med major. While there, he joined the Reserve Officer Training Corps, and excelled. During the course of his studies, Jones discovered he was not cut out to be a doctor. Instead he focused himself on drama, with the thought of doing something he enjoyed, before, he assumed, he would have to go off to fight in the Korean War. After four years of college, Jones left without his degree. In 1953 he found a part-time stage crew job at the Ramsdell Theatre in Manistee, Michigan, which marked the beginning of his acting career. During the 1955\u20131957 seasons he was an actor and stage manager. He performed his first portrayal of Shakespeare\u2019s Othello in this theater in 1955. After his discharge from the Military, Jones moved to New York, where he attended the American Theatre Wing to further his training and worked as a janitor to earn a living. His first film role was as a young and trim Lt. Lothar Zogg, the B-52 bombardier in Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb in 1964. His first big role came with his portrayal of boxer Jack Jefferson in the film version of the Broadway play The Great White Hope, which was based on the life of boxer Jack Johnson. For his role, Jones was nominated Best Actor by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, making him the second African-American male performer (following Sidney Poitier) to receive a nomination. In 1969, Jones participated in making test films for a proposed children's television series; these shorts, combined with animated segments were the beginnings of the Sesame Street format. The next year, in the early 1970s, James appeared with Diahann Carroll in the film called Claudine.  While he has appeared in many roles, he is well known as the voice of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy. Darth Vader was portrayed in costume by David Prowse in the original trilogy, with Jones dubbing Vader's dialogue in postproduction due to Prowse's strong West Country accent being unsuitable for the role. At his own request, he was originally uncredited for the release of the first two films (he would later be credited for the two in the 1997 re-release). \u00a0His other voice roles include Mufasa in the 1994 film Disney animated blockbuster The Lion King, and its direct-to-video sequel, The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. He also has done the CNN tagline, \"This is CNN\", as well as \"This is CNN International\", and the Bell Atlantic tagline, \"Bell Atlantic: The heart of communication\". When Bell Atlantic became Verizon, Jones used the tagline greeting of \"Welcome to Verizon\" or \"Verizon 411\" right before a phone call would go through. The opening for NBC's coverage of the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics; \"the Big PI in the Sky\" (God) in the computer game Under a Killing Moon; a Claymation film about The Creation; and several guest spots on The Simpsons.  In addition to his film and voice over work, Jones is an accomplished stage actor as well; he has won Tony awards in 1969 for The Great White Hope and in 1987 for Fences. Othello, King Lear, Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Abhorson in Measure for Measure, and Claudius in Hamlet are Shakespearean roles he has played. He received Kennedy Center Honors in 2002.  Jones has been married to actress Cecilia Hart since 1982. They have one child, Flynn Earl Jones. He was previously married to American actress/singer Julienne Marie (born March 21, 1933, Toledo, Ohio); they had no children.

This attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg, who was developing Saving Private Ryan (1998); Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear. He subsequently voiced the titular character in The Iron Giant (1999) while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining the Fast & Furious, XXX, and The Chronicles of Riddick film franchises.\n\nDiesel voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and its sequel (2017), as well as Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018). Away from action films, he has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as the comedy film The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised. Diesel portrayed the comic book superhero Bloodshot in its 2020 film adaptation and is slated to appear in the Avatar sequels.\n\nHe founded the production company One Race Films, where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for a number of his star vehicles. Diesel also founded the record label Racetrack Records and video game developer Tigon Studios and has provided his voice and motion capture for all of Tigon's releases.\n\nDescription above is from the Wikipedia article Vin Diesel, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "photoUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/dALF5XEkrduze1obQNF2uZMiQHr.jpg"}, {"id": 1222992, "name": "Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez", "gender": 1, "birthday": "1990-01-30", "deathday": null, "biography": "Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez was born on January 30, 1990 in Mexico City, Distrito  Federal, Mexico as Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez Reyna.

Jolie has promoted humanitarian causes throughout the world, and is noted for her work with refugees as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). She has been cited as one of the world's most beautiful women and her off-screen life is widely reported.\n\nThough she made her screen debut as a child alongside her father Jon Voight in the 1982 film Lookin' to Get Out, Jolie's acting career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993). Her first leading role in a major film was in Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).

Johnson is half-Black and half-Samoan. His father, Rocky Johnson, is a Black Canadian, from Nova Scotia, and part of the first Black tag team champions in WWE history back when it was known as the WWF along with Tony Atlas. His mother is Samoan and the daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a pro wrestler. Maivia's wife, Lia Maivia, was one of wrestling's few female promoters, taking over Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982, until 1988. Through his mother, he is considered a non-blood relative of the Anoa'i wrestling family. On March 29, 2008, The Rock inducted his father and his grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nAs of 2014, Johnson has a home in Southwest Ranches, Florida as well as Los Angeles, California. He also owns a farm in Virginia. In 2009, Johnson gained citizenship in Canada in honor of his father's background. Though Johnson was previously registered as a Republican, he voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 United States presidential elections and is now an independent voter. He stated he did not vote in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nIn recognition of his service to the Samoan people, and because he is a descendant of Samoan chiefs, Johnson had the noble title of Seiuli bestowed upon him by Malietoa Tanumafili II during his visit there in July 2004. He received a partial Samoan pe'a tattoo on his left side in 2003,and, in 2017, had the small \"Brahma bull\" tattoo on his right arm covered with a larger half-sleeve tattoo of a bull's skull.\n\nJohnson married Dany Garcia on May 3, 1997. Their only child together, a daughter named Simone, was born in August 2001. On June 1, 2007, they announced they were splitting up amicably. Johnson then began dating Lauren Hashian, daughter of Boston drummer Sib Hashian. They first met in 2006 while Johnson was filming The Game Plan. Their first child together, a daughter, was born in December 2015. Their second child, another daughter, was born in April 2018.\n\nJohnson attended the 2000 Democratic National Convention as part of WWE's non-partisan \"Smackdown Your Vote\" campaign, which aimed to influence young people to vote. He also had a speaking role at the 2000 Republican National Convention that same year.\n\nIn 2006, Johnson founded the Dwayne Johnson Rock Foundation, a charity working with at-risk and terminally ill children. On October 2, 2007, he and his ex-wife donated $1 million to the University of Miami to support the renovation of its football facilities; it was noted as the largest donation ever given to the university's athletics department by former students. The University of Miami renamed the Hurricanes' locker room in Johnson's honor. In 2015, Johnson donated $1,500 to a GoFundMe to pay for an abandoned dog's surgery. In 2017, he donated $25,000 to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. In 2018, Johnson donated a gym to a military base in Oahu, Hawaii. After the 2018 Hawaii floods, he worked with Malama Kauai, a nonprofit organization, to help repair damages caused by the floods.", "photoUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/cgoy7t5Ve075naBPcewZrc08qGw.jpg"}, {"id": 55638, "name": "Kevin Hart", "gender": 2, "birthday": "1979-07-06", "deathday": null, "biography": "Kevin Darnell Hart (born July 6, 1979) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, and producer.
